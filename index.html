            The Chanaa brothers, Adam and Jalal, first hit the Dallas restaurant scene in 1989, opening the first Ali Baba Mediterranean Grill concept on Lower Greenville in a small 800 square foot venue. The little establishment quickly became a favorite to many in the East Dallas area and soon there was a line out the door and down the street daily. The brothers kept the quality of their food high and slowly increased their reach throughout the Dallas area. Over the next two decades they added several new locations, 2 in Dallas and 1 in Monterey, Mexico. Nearly 30 years later Ali Baba is still an iconic stop for locals and tourists alike. <br>
            <br>
            Since 2010 Adam and Jalal have perfected their recipes, revamped the menu, created new menu items, and grown each location to be what it is today. We are  known for creating classic & authentic dishes featuring staples of the Mediterranean diet. The combination of our fresh fruits & vegetables, quality meats & seafood, and authentic international ingredients create flavors that are distinctly delicious. Terra and Ali Baba have become a well known place to grab a quick, fast, & fresh lunch and a wonderful place to enjoy a glass of wine over dinner with family & friends. </P>
